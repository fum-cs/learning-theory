# Implement Kernel K-means Algorithm

## Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to modify the existing incorrect implementation of kernel K-means in the provided GitHub repository and implement the kernel K-means algorithm from the Zaki data mining book (Chapter 13).

## Instructions:
1. Clone the provided GitHub repository from: https://github.com/rarezhang/Kmeans-and-Kernel-Kmeans
2. Locate the incorrect implementation of kernel K-means in the repository.
3. Understand the algorithm of kernel K-means from the Zaki data mining book (Chapter 13).
4. Modify the existing code to implement the kernel K-means algorithm as per the book.
5. Implement the algorithm in a Jupyter notebook.
6. Provide comments explaining each step of the algorithm.
7. Test the implementation using a dataset of your choice.
8. Display the output of the algorithm which includes the cluster assignments of each data point.

## Submission:
Submit the Jupyter notebook containing the modified and correct implementation of the kernel K-means algorithm, along with the output showing the cluster assignments of the dataset in vu.um.ac.ir.
